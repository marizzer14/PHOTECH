                     <p>PhoTech is more than just a photo printing service; we're a student-run business corporation dedicated to blending creativity with innovation. As part of our Entrepreneurship and Empowerment Technology project at Don Bosco Senior High School Paranaque, we aim to provide affordable, convenient, and high-quality photo printing services to the school community. We turn digital photos into lasting physical prints using custom-designed templates and premium materials.</p>

                     <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                     <p>We envision a school community where photo printing is convenient, accessible, and affordable for every student—without the need to travel far or wait in long lines.</p>

                     <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                     <p>Our mission is to deliver fast, affordable, and high-quality photo printing services tailored specifically for students. We aim to reduce the stress of errands by bringing printing closer to home or campus, using available resources and student-friendly prices.</p>

                     <p>This venture is our way of putting classroom learning into real-world practice, blending entrepreneurship with the power of technology to create something truly valuable. As a BMBE-supported business, we are committed to ethical practices, community engagement, and sustainable operations.</p>
